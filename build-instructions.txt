HOW TO BUILD
Originally, this project was built using an old version of Microsoft Visual Studio. Since this relied on deprecated libraries and caused a bunch of strife to build again, I made a Makefile to make it easy to compile using MinGW. This should be relatively future-proof.

To build Moonbase Console, you'll need to install MinGW, with the C++ compiler. Navigate to the root directory and type "make".

Currently, you'll need to place the .exe file in the same directory as Moonbase Commander to get it working properly, and you'll probably need to run it as Administrator.

I've left the original Visual Studio project files there for convenience sake.
