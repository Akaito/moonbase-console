Just a running list of things I plan to do for this, so when I lose interest and pick it up again 9 months later I can see what needs to be done.

- Add more IP address finder inputs
- Implement change control dialog
- Put self in credits
- Update readme with changes
- Increase version number
- Add (symmetrical) (asymmetrical)
- Make it work with steam version/multiple versions of Windows
