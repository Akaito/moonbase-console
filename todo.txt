Just a running list of things I plan to do for this, so when I lose interest and pick it up again 9 months later I can see what needs to be done. A plus means it's done.

+ Add more IP address finder inputs
- Implement change control dialog
- Put self in credits
- Update readme with changes
- Increase version number
- Add (symmetrical) (asymmetrical) to Spiff and Katton respectively
- Make it work with steam version/multiple versions of Windows
- Upload .exe to somewhere, possibly Dropbox? PDrive? Or use Github releases
- Put in smarts to find moonbase.ini. Maybe allow user to customise path? 
- Toggle fullscreen from settings (may require access to registry)
- Make the button IDs a little bit saner



Maybe:
- Use a different UI framework cos this one is really annoying to work with (Qt?)
-- I think I'll do this for the next version, I hate this current framework. I'm going to make version 2.2 workable (if possibly buggy) and then direct my efforts to making a Qt version for 3.0)
